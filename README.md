# IoT and AI-Powered Smart Agriculture Solution

## Overview

Our innovative solution integrates IoT and AI technologies to address key agricultural challenges such as pests, diseases, and improper fertilization and irrigation. The system features an IoT kit equipped with infrared sensors to detect pests, ultrasonic transducers to repel them, and UV lights to attract pests to sticky traps. Additionally, automated sprinklers are employed to apply neem oil when pests are detected. For disease management, ESP camera modules detect issues early and trigger natural treatments. Environmental sensors continuously monitor soil conditions to optimize irrigation and predict disease outbreaks, while smart fertigation ensures precise fertilizer application. 

A machine learning-enhanced web app identifies pests and diseases from images uploaded by users, providing voice recommendations and actionable insights in the userâ€™s preferred language. An integrated LLM chatbot offers instant agricultural advice, answering farmers' questions and providing timely notifications about new and existing agricultural schemes. This comprehensive approach aims to increase crop yields, improve environmental sustainability, enhance farmer health, and ensure efficient resource use, ultimately supporting sustainable agriculture practices and boosting productivity.
